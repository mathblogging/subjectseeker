<h2>What is Mathblogging.org?</h2>

<p>From research to recreational, from teaching to technology, from visual to virtual, hundreds of blogs and sites regularly write about mathematics in all its facets. For the longest time, there was no good way for readers to find the authors they enjoy and for authors to be found. We want to change that.</p>

<p>We have collected over 700 blogs and other news sources in one place, and invite you to submit even more! Our goal is to be the best place to discover mathematical writing on the web. For the longest time, we used our own open source <a href="https://github.com/fbreuer/mathblogging">software</a> for Mathblogging.org. But we recently switched to the excellent (and equally <a href="http://code.google.com/p/subjectseeker/">open source</a>) <a href="http://subjectseeker.scienceseeker.org/index.php">SubjectSeeker</a>. SubjectSeeker is developed by our friends at <a href="http://scienceseeker.org">ScienceSeeker</a>, a project of <a href="http://scienceonline.com/">ScienceOnline</a> designed to fill the greater need for the scientific blogosphere.</p>

<h2>What Mathblogging.org Does</h2>

<p>This site is a work in progress. Sources are categorized according to a fixed list of topics. You can see lists of posts from those sources, but since many math bloggers have wide-ranging interests, some of the topics might not quite fit. You can see the specific topics a writer has chosen for her posts by clicking on the "…" bubble next to each post, and you can click on those topics to find other posts on the same topic. We have other ways of arranging posts as well: just the best posts, chosen by experts, popular posts on Twitter. Users can recommend posts and write notes explaining what they like about those posts.</p>

<p>You can search for posts, blogs, or other sources using keywords you specify, and you can create a custom feed to follow using a feedreader like Google Reader, or use the Mathblogging.org Widget to place that feed on your own site.</p>

<p>Readers can follow Mathblogging.org by visiting the site, subscribing to a <a href="/api">custom feed</a>, or following us on social media sites. We have four Twitter feeds (<a title="A Twitter feed of just the Mathblogging.org Editors’ Picks" href="https://twitter.com/#!/mathbloggingeds">Editors' Picks</a>, <a title="All the posts on Mathblogging.org in a Twitter feed" href="https://twitter.com/#!/mathbloggingAll">Recent Posts</a>, <a title="A Twitter feed collecting all notes made on Mathblogging.org" href="https://twitter.com/#!/mathbloggingnts">Notes</a>, and <a title="The official Mathblogging.org Twitter account, with news and notes on Mathblogging.org" href="https://twitter.com/#!/mathblogging">the official Mathblogging.org Twitter account</a>).

<h2>The Mathblogging.org Team</h2>

<p><strong><a href="http://boolesrings.org/scoskey">Samuel Coskey</a></strong>, Mathblogging.org's tech wizard, teaches math at Boise State University and does research in set theory. Together with Peter, he started <a href="http://boolesrings.org">boolesrings.org</a> to help mathematicians use their academic home page as a blog for professional activities. Sam also runs <a href="http://mathtalks.org">mathtalks.org</a>.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://ta.twi.tudelft.nl/wst/users/heymann/">Frederik von Heymann</></a></strong>, <a href="http://mathblogging.wordpress.com/">chief mathematical-instrument</a>, is working on his PhD in optimization at the TU Delft. Fred co-founded Mathblogging.org and when he's not on a train to Zurich, he can be found on his bike, racing the winds of Holland.

<p><strong><a href="http://boolesrings.org/krautzberger">Peter Krautzberger</a></strong>, Managing Editor of Mathblogging.org, studied mathematics in Munich, Berlin, and Ann Arbor. He works for <a href="http://www.mathjax.org">MathJax</a> and co-founded mathblogging.org and <a href="http://boolesrings.org/">boolesrings.org</a>.</p>


<h3>Editors</h3>

<p> <strong>Dana Ernst</strong> is a professor of mathematics at <a href="http://nau.edu">Northern Arizona University</a> in Flagstaff, AZ, and blogs at <a href="danaernst.com">danaernst.com</a>. Dana is passionate about mathematics education and his scholarly activities include topics in this area. In particular, he is interested in <a href="http://maamathedmatters.blogspot.com/2013/05/what-heck-is-ibl.html">inquiry-based learning</a> (IBL) as a method for teaching mathematics. Dana is also a Special Projects Coordinator for the <a href="http://www.inquirybasedlearning.org/">Academy of Inquiry-Based Learning</a> and actively gives <a href="http://danaernst.com/category/talks">talks</a> and organizes workshops on the benefits of IBL as well as the nuts and bolts of how to implement this approach in the mathematics classroom. Together with Angie Hodge, Dana is a coauthor for <a href="http://maamathedmatters.blogspot.com/">Math Ed Matters</a>, which is a (roughly) monthly column sponsored by the <a href="http://maa.org">MAA</a>. Lastly, Dana is an avid cyclist, trail runner, and rock climber. Oh, and he enjoys drinking copious amounts of coffee. </p>

<p><strong>Patrick Honner</strong> is an award-winning high school math teacher currently residing in Brooklyn, New York.  Patrick has taught everything from introductory algebra to multivariable Calculus, and mentors student research and writing in mathematics.  Patrick is a regular contributor to the <a href="http://learning.blogs.nytimes.com/">New York Times Learning Network</a>, and shares his love of mathematics and teaching through writing and photography at <a href="http://www.MrHonner.com">MrHonner.com</a>.</p>

<p> <strong>Fawn Nguyen</strong> teaches math at Mesa Union Junior High in southern California. She started out as a science teacher for 14 years and has been teaching math for the last 10 years. Fawn is part of the UC-Santa Barbara Mathematics Project leadership team that presents at workshops and retreats for math teachers, coaches, and administrators in the Tri-County area. She is a co-founder of the  <a href="http://www.mathteacherscircleto.org/">Thousand Oaks Math Teachers’ Circle</a>. In an effort to share and learn from other math teachers, Fawn blogs at <a href="http://fawnnguyen.com/">Finding Ways to Nguyen Students Over</a>. She also started <a href="http://visualpatterns.org/">VisualPatterns.org</a> to help students develop algebraic thinking. When she can pull herself away from her passion and love of all things mathy, Fawn likes to take motorcycle rides with her husband.</p>

<p><strong>Shecky Riemann</strong> is the fanciful pseudonym of a former psychology major and lab-tech (primarily clinical genetics), who's been enamored of mathematics since childhood. Following Martin Gardner's death (2010), he was inspired to create <a href="http://math-frolic.blogspot.com/">Math-Frolic</a> blog to pay tribute to Gardner and be a cheerleader-of-sorts for those doing, or interested in, mathematics. He's especially intrigued with number theory, geometry, and the philosophical underpinnings of math. Cats, parrots and shelties adore him.</p>
