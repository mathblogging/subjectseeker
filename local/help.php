<p>Mathblogging.org is designed as a convenient place to check on the mathematical blogosphere. You can find and follow over 700 mathematical blogs and sites covering all aspects of mathematics. This means each day you will find hundreds of pieces on topics ranging from research to recreational, from teaching to technology, from graphical to just great. Our goal is to help you find great mathematical content -- and help authors to find great readers.</p>

<p>If you have a mathematical blog or other regularly-updated mathematical site, we want it to be on Mathblogging.org!</p>

<p>You can easily register, find out if a site is already on Mathblogging.org, and submit a site if it isn't. A Mathblogging.org editor will visit the site to make sure it's about mathematics, then approve the account; all its posts will be added to our site and feeds.</p>

<h2>Registration</h2>

<p>To register, click on the Register link in the upper-right corner. You'll be given the option of entering a username and email address, or registering automatically using your Twitter account. Choose this option if you don't want a separate username and password for this site.</p>

<p>Once you register following the on-screen directions, you can login and change your settings, including uploading a photo, URL, and biography.</p>

<h2>Submitting a site</h2>

<p>Anyone can submit a new source to Mathblogging.org, even if they aren't the site's author. To submit a site, click on "Add Site" at the top of the page. Enter the URL of the site or the site's RSS or Atom feed. Add in all the remaining information on the following form. Make sure you select at least one category that describes the site's content. If you have a large number of sources to add to the system, please <a href="/contact/">contact us</a> to discuss a data upload.</p>

<p>If you want to be identified as an author of the site, check the relevant box. To verify that you can really post content to your site, Mathblogging.org will provide a code for you to put in a post on your site. Paste it in near the top of the <b>most recent</b> post on your feed (don't worry, the code is invisible to readers). Once you have added the code to your site, click on "Continue to the next step" and our system will visit the site to verify that the code is present. (<i>If this doesn't work right away, give it a few minutes and try again. Sometimes it just takes a moment for the information to propagate</i>) 

<p>Once your site is submitted, an editor will check it to verify your information and approve it, usually within 24 hours. It won't appear on our site until it has been approved.</p>
